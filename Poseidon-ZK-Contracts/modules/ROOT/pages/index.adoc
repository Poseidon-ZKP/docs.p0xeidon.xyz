= Contracts

*A library for secure smart contract development.* Build on a solid foundation of community-vetted code.

== Overview

[[install]]
=== Installation

```console
$ npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```


[[usage]]
=== Usage

Once installed, you can use the contracts in the library by importing them:

[source,solidity]
----
// contracts/MyNFT.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721 {
    constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT") {
    }
}
----


To keep your system secure, you should **always** use the installed code as-is, and neither copy-paste it from online sources, nor modify it yourself. The library is designed so that only the contracts and functions you use are deployed, so you don't need to worry about it needlessly increasing gas costs.
