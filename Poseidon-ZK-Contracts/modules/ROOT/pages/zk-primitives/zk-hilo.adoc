= Build your own ZK game

== ü§î What are we building?

[abstract]
We will build a zero-knowledge game "zk-HiLo" using Poseidon's zk-sdk. 
Zk-HiLo is intended as a 'Hello World' example for using the Poseidon Labs zkShuffle contracts.
This repo contains a set of contracts and a frontend web app for playing an on-chain, zk-Powered game of Hi-Lo against a server.

== ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

[sectnumlevels=3]
Our tech stack would be composed of Next.js for front-end, and hardhat for local contract testing.
