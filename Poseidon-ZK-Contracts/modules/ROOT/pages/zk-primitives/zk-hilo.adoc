= Build your own ZK game

== 🤔 What are we building?

[abstract]
We will build a zero-knowledge game "zk-HiLo" using Poseidon's zk-sdk. 
Zk-HiLo is intended as a 'Hello World' example for using the Poseidon Labs zkShuffle contracts.
This repo contains a set of contracts and a frontend web app for playing an on-chain, zk-Powered game of Hi-Lo against a server.

== ⚙️ Environment Setup

[sectnumlevels=3]
Our tech stack would be composed of Next.js for front-end, and hardhat for local contract testing. 

=== 🗃️ Step 1: Download our sample code

[TODO]
Go to <Placeholder> to download latest code.

=== Step 2: Setup backend

[TODO]
* In the /contracts directory:
[source,bash]
yarn install
npx hardhat node
* Open another terminal and run:
[source,bash]
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts

=== Step 3: Setup frontend

[TODO]
* In the /frontend directory:
[source,bash]
yarn install
